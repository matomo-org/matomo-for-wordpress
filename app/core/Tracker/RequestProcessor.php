/**
 * Base class for all tracker RequestProcessors. RequestProcessors handle and respond to tracking
 * requests.
 *
 * ## Concept: Request Metadata
 *
 * RequestProcessors take a Tracker\Request object and based on its information, set request metadata.
 *
 * Request metadata is information about the current tracking request, for example, whether
 * the request is for an existing visit or new visit, or whether the current visitor is a known
 * visitor, etc. It is used to control tracking behavior.
 *
 * Request metadata is shared between RequestProcessors, so RequestProcessors can tweak each others
 * behavior, and thus, the behavior of the Tracker. Request metadata can be set and get using the
 * {@link Request::setMetadata()} and {@link Request::getMetadata()}
 * methods.
 *
 * Each RequestProcessor lists the request metadata it computes and exposes in its class
 * documentation.
 *
 * ## The Tracking Process
 *
 * When Piwik handles a single tracking request, it gathers all available RequestProcessors and
 * invokes their methods in sequence.
 *
 * The first method called is {@link self::manipulateRequest()}. By default this is a no-op, but
 * RequestProcessors can use it to manipulate tracker requests before they are processed.
 *
 * The second method called is {@link self::processRequestParams()}. RequestProcessors should use
 * this method to compute request metadata and set visit properties using the tracking request.
 * An example includes the ActionRequestProcessor, which uses this method to determine the action
 * being tracked.
 *
 * The third method called is {@link self::afterRequestProcessed()}. RequestProcessors should
 * use this method to either compute request metadata/visit properties using other plugins'
 * request metadata, OR override other plugins' request metadata to tweak tracker behavior.
 * An example of the former can be seen in the GoalsRequestProcessor which uses the action
 * detected by the ActionsRequestProcessor to see if there are any action-matching goal
 * conversions. An example of the latter can be seen in the PingRequestProcessor, which on
 * ping requests, aborts conversion recording and new visit recording.
 *
 * After these methods are called, either {@link self::onNewVisit()} or {@link self::onExistingVisit()}
 * is called. Generally, plugins should favor defining Dimension classes instead of using these methods,
 * however sometimes it is not possible (as is the case with the CustomVariables plugin).
 *
 * Finally, the {@link self::recordLogs()} method is called. In this method, RequestProcessors
 * should use the request metadata that was set (and maybe overridden) to insert whatever log data
 * they want.
 *
 * ## Extending The Piwik Tracker
 *
 * Plugins that want to change the tracking process in order to track new data or change how
 * existing data is tracked can create RequestProcessors to accomplish.
 *
 * _Note: If you only want to add tracked data to visits, actions or conversions, you should create
 * a {@link Dimension} class._
 *
 * To create a new RequestProcessor, create a new class that derives from this one, and implement the
 * methods you need. Then put this class inside the `Tracker` directory of your plugin.
 *
 * Final note: RequestProcessors are shared between tracking requests, and so, should ideally be
 * stateless. They are stored in DI, so they can contain references to other objects in DI, but
 * they shouldn't contain data that might change between tracking requests.
