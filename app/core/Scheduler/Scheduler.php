/**
 * Schedules task execution.
 *
 * A scheduled task is a callback that should be executed every so often (such as daily,
 * weekly, monthly, etc.). They are registered by extending {@link \Piwik\Plugin\Tasks}.
 *
 * Tasks are executed when the `core:archive` command is executed.
 *
 * ### Examples
 *
 * **Scheduling a task**
 *
 *     class Tasks extends \Piwik\Plugin\Tasks
 *     {
 *         public function schedule()
 *         {
 *             $this->hourly('myTask');  // myTask() will be executed once every hour
 *         }
 *         public function myTask()
 *         {
 *             // do something
 *         }
 *     }
 *
 * **Executing all pending tasks**
 *
 *     $results = $scheduler->run();
 *     $task1Result = $results[0];
 *     $task1Name = $task1Result['task'];
 *     $task1Output = $task1Result['output'];
 *
 *     echo "Executed task '$task1Name'. Task output:\n$task1Output";
