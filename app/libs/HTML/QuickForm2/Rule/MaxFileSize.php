     * Rule checking that uploaded file size does not exceed the given limit
     *
     * The Rule needs one configuration parameter for its work: the size limit.
     * This limit can be passed either to
     * {@link HTML_QuickForm2_Rule::__construct() the Rule constructor} as local
     * configuration or to {@link HTML_QuickForm2_Factory::registerRule()} as
     * global one. As usual, global configuration overrides local one.
     *
     * Note that if file upload failed due to upload_max_filesize php.ini setting
     * or MAX_FILE_SIZE form field, then this rule won't even be called, due to
     * File element's built-in validation setting the error message.
     *
     * The Rule considers missing file uploads (UPLOAD_ERR_NO_FILE) valid.
