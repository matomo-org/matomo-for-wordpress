# Matomo Custom Variables Plugin

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/matomo-org/plugin-CustomVariables.svg?branch=4.x-dev)](https://travis-ci.org/matomo-org/plugin-CustomVariables)

## Description

This plugins allows you to configure and track [Custom Variables](https://matomo.org/docs/custom-variables/) in your Matomo Analytics. 

This feature used to be part of Matomo. However, we no longer plan to further develop custom variables and only fix important bugs or security issues and we might stop supporting Custom Variables in the future. 

We therefore highly recommend using [Custom Dimensions](https://matomo.org/docs/custom-dimensions/) instead which is directly available within your Matomo. Learn more about the [advantages of Custom Dimensions](https://matomo.org/faq/general/faq_21117/).

**Warning**: Depending on the database size of your Matomo this plugin may take a long time to install.
