Unlike with those other guys at Google who have all your sensitive data stored on their servers and make you sign away control of your information. Having Matomo Analytics hosted on your servers means we’re out of the picture and you’re in full control of your data!

Matomo leads the way in data privacy and even comes well-equipped with its own GDPR Manager. Government agencies; financial and educational institutions; web hosting providers; and other data sensitive businesses and organisations all trust Matomo to deliver to the highest standards when it comes to supporting them to be GDPR compliant.

If you’re currently using free Google Analytics, this means you’re potentially at risk of being presented with inaccurate data, as Google Analytics caps the amount of accurate data you’re presented with through its data sampling limitations. With Matomo, nothing is sampled and you’re presented with 100% real data meaning you can make smarter data-driven decisions based on the facts.

Over 1.4 million websites in over 190 countries are using Matomo already. Join the revolution too! Install Matomo on your Wordpress website completely free and take back full control of your data!
