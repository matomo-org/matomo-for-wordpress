**Prerequisites and technical requirements:**

Running Matomo Analytics on your server can use significant resources. Whenever someone visits your WordPress website, your server will need to serve your WordPress pages to the user, as well as tracking the user journey in Matomo, resulting in an additional request for each page view.

* The minimum PHP memory limit is 128Mb, but we recommend to use a higher limit (memory_limit = 256M).
* PHP 7.2 at minimum is required.
* If you have high traffic website, or manage a lot of websites with WordPress MultiSite, we recommend installing [Matomo On-Premise](https://matomo.org/docs/installation/) or signup to [Matomo Cloud](https://matomo.org/hosting/) and install the [WP-Matomo plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-piwik/) instead.
